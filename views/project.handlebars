                        <p>Exotic CarSwap is an application where exotic cars can be rented. This application
                            is similar to airbnb where a user can rent out any exotic cars available for rent with
                            specific start and end date. In addition, a user also has the capability of putting their
                            cars up for renting given a specific start and end date they want the cars to be available
                            for. If the user has too many options or choices to choose from then the user can answer
                            a questionaire and based on that we will recommend a car they should rent.
